#Installation
For now the only way to use PSYSlot is download/clone the project and copu the directory PSYSlot into your project. (will add the project cocoapods as soon as possible)

#Customisation
You can do any type of customisation(color, border, shadow, etc) which normally we do with UIView

#limitation
For now, you cannot change the size of the control view vertically.
